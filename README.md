CMU MSBA Capstone Project: Matching Customers with Leimberg Service's Newspaper
Welcome to my CMU MSBA Capstone Project! The aim of this project is to address the email marketing problem faced by Leimberg Service, an information services company. The company publishes newsletters and articles related to various domains such as the financial market, real estate market, agriculture, and law.

## Problem Statement
Currently, Leimberg Service's subscribers face an issue where they receive all the newsletters, even if they are not interested in certain topics. This has led to dissatisfaction among subscribers, resulting in increased churn rates as they seek more specialized services from competitors like the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times.

## Project Objective
As the project leader, I have devised a data-driven approach to increase Leimberg Service's subscription and retention rates. The goal is to improve the relevance and personalization of newsletters, ensuring that subscribers receive content tailored to their interests.

## Approach and Methodology
To achieve the project objective, the following steps will be undertaken:

Data Collection: Gather data on subscriber preferences, newsletter content, and past engagement metrics.

Data Analysis: Conduct an in-depth analysis of subscriber preferences, identifying patterns and trends.

Summary Web Crawler: Extracting the Executive Summary of Each Newsletter.

NLP Key Word Extraction Model: A. Extracting the Key Words of Each Newsletter
                               B. Extracting the Key Words of Each Industry

Subscribers Clustering Model: A. Manually Tagging Subscribers First Industry and Second Industry
                              B. Using Location, First Industry, Second Industry to Clustering

Cluster Matching: A. Find the Key Words of Each Cluster
                  B. Matching up Newsletters and Clusters
                  
Performance Evaluation: Monitor and measure the impact of the approach on subscription and retention rates. Analyze feedback from subscribers to assess satisfaction levels.
